          The premise of Pandoraâ€™s Awakening stems from the Greek myth of Pandoraâ€™s box.

        <TextSection classNames="mt-5">
          In Greek mythology, Pandora was the first woman on Earth. 
          As a gift on her wedding night Zeus presented her with a beautiful box, 
          and instructed her not to open it under any circumstances. 
          Stricken with curiosity (also a gift given to her by the gods), 
          Pandora opened the box which contained all of the evils and detriments of the world. 
          Pandora quickly attempted to close the box, but to her dismay all of the evils had already escaped. 
          Pandora was deeply saddened by her actions and feared the consequences of Zeus. 
          However, Zeus did not punish her because he knew this would happen. 
          What Pandora didnâ€™t realize at the time was that at the bottom of the box existed the solution to her problems, Hope.

          &quot;I live by the philosophy that everyone on this earth plays a vital part 
          in the success and failures of their community, and I prefer to play on the side of success. 
          Analyzing and learning functions of relationships has always been a great passion of mine. 
          I believe relationships are the driving force behind our existence.&quot;
