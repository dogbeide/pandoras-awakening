          You may be experiencing doubts, questions, or limitations when it comes
          to your sexual identity. Perhaps you and your partner have differing

          It’s possible that your sexual functioning has changed over time, and
          you are now struggling with aspects of anxiety and grief when it comes
          to performing. Maybe a medical issue has caused a decrease in your
          desire, or perhaps you struggle with vaginismus (vaginal pain during
          sexual intercourse) or erectile dysfunction. If this is the case, you
          may become stressed or worried about the idea of being intimate,

          When drive and desire between partners differ, it can create tension in
          the relationship. It’s entirely possible that you and your partner no

          as a result, you may be looking for support in navigating a path
          forward.&nbsp;

          Like most of us, you may have developed negative associations with your
          body and sexuality throughout your adulthood. Yet sex therapy can
          normalize your experience and give you the necessary tools for
          overcoming obstacles to your passion, intimacy, and sexual fulfillment.
          And if you struggle with medical issues, including vaginismus or

          At Pandora’s Awakening, we see both individuals and couples for sex
          counseling. Beginning with a brief consultation, we will work to
          determine the presenting issues in your sex life and match you with the
          therapist that is best suited to help you overcome challenges. As we go
          through the intake process (spanning over a few sessions), your
          therapist will be able to develop a treatment plan geared toward your
          needs as an individual or couple.

        <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
          Throughout your time in sex therapy, you will be invited to delve into
          your history as a sexual being. This includes examining the possible
          trauma and grief that have impacted your relationship with yourself and
          your body. And whether you’re participating as an individual or a
          couple, counseling provides a great opportunity to learn more about how
          your and your partner’s desires were shaped and the kinds of challenges
          that you both may face when it comes to issues of sexual intimacy.&nbsp;

          Moreover, your therapist will work with you to help you unlearn the
          negative or counterproductive education you’ve received when it comes to
          understanding your body. In doing so, therapy can help you develop a
          critical awareness of the emotional aspects of intimacy, as well as the
          tools for processing the relational, psychosexual, and mental elements
          of your sexuality.&nbsp;

          Our approach to sex therapy often involves mindfulness techniques and
          tools that revolve around a deeper awareness of the sensations occurring
          in your body. And while sex therapy sessions are customized to meet the
          needs of each individual or couple, we are likely to draw from
          frameworks developed by such renowned sex and relationship therapists as
          Masters and Johnson, The Kinsey Institute, Helen Kaplan, Esther Perel,
          and Emily Nagoski. These experts have pioneered the field of sex therapy
          and offer a new, nonbinary, and radically accepting way of exploring
          sex, intimacy, and the body.&nbsp;

          With the right support, it’s possible to have a satisfying and

          physical discomfort, emotional distress, or cultural limitations, with
          therapy at Pandora’s Awakening, you can achieve a more satisfying and

          Sex therapy is meant to be a profound mental and emotional exploration
          of your sexuality. As such, counseling is not a workshop or instruction
          in the physical act of sex, but rather an opportunity to overcome the
          various obstacles that have caused you to feel unsatisfied in the
          bedroom. We will certainly make space to discuss specific organs, acts,
          and physical sensations, but there is no nudity—nor is sex therapy
          intended to be obscene, uncomfortable, or profane.
